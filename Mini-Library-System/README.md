The **Mini Library System** is a simple console-based Java application designed to help manage a small library. It demonstrates basic **object-oriented programming** concepts and uses **data structures** like **queues** and **stacks**.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books with an ID, title, and author.  
- **Borrow Books (Queue)**: Keep track of who borrows which book using a queue system.  
- **Return Books (Stack)**: Track returned books in the order they are returned using a stack.  
- **Search Books**: Search for books by title or author.  
- **Sort Books**: Sort books alphabetically by title or author.  
- **Display Books**: View all available books in the library.

2. Choose an option from the menu.
3. Follow prompts to add, borrow, return, search, sort, or display books.
4. Exit the system when finished.
